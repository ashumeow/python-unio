uni-unicode!

  uni-unicode is a Python module that tries to set an end to all unicode
  problems.  What it does is providing explicit access to binary and
  unicode data for both Python 2 and 3 that work exactly the same on both
  systems and considerably better than the builtin defaults.

What it gives you:

  * explicit access to stdin/stdout/stderr in both binary and text mode
  * improved file open functions that work the same on 2.x and 3.x that
    handle all encodings for you and come with sensible defaults
  * helper functions to deal with all of the crazy Python 3 unicode
    encoding edge cases
  * sane APIs to work with filesystem paths on 2.x and 3.x
